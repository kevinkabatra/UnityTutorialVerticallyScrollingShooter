Learn to pronounce
noun
the effect whereby the position or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions, e.g. through the viewfinder and the lens of a camera.
"what you see in the viewfinder won't be quite what you get in the photograph because of parallax error"
From Oxford Languages

Parallax (from Ancient Greek παράλλαξις (parallaxis) 'alternation') is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.[1][2] Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

What the hell does that mean? Luckily the Wikipedia entry has a section for `Visual Perception` that explains that due to humans having our eyes in two different positions on our head we are continually viewing items from two different view points. This is how our brain attempts to gain depth perception by using parallax in a process known as [stereopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopsis).
